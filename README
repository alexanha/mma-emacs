MMA-EMACS
=========

To install the math mode:
-------------------------
- copy the files math.el  mathem-mode.el to ~/.emacs.d/elisp
- append to content of init.el.delta to your ~/.emacs.d/init.el
- make sure the line
   (load-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")
  is in your ~/.emacs

Tweaks to use the math mode Mathematica versions >= 9.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------
From version 9.0.0 onwards the MathKernel is compiled with the readline
library, which destoys the working of this math mode. If you have write
access to the installation directory of Mma, you can fix this by
deleting the file 'libterm.so'. If you want readline support
nevertheless, there is a package called "rlwrap" (so set up an alias to
'rlwrap math').

Short instruction:
------------------
- the math-mode is loaded when a .m-file is loaded
- start the kernel with Ctrl-Alt-M or Alt-Return
- send a line to the kernel with Ctrl-Alt-M or Alt-Return
- mark a region, and send the region with Ctrl+C
